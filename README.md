# Chainmail Pricing

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to scrape data from various chainmail supply vendors to get pricinging data on the rings they sell. I plan to store and organize the data so that comparisons across vendors can be fairly carried out.

## Responsibility

For each of the vendors whose websites I will scrape in this project I will check their website for a robots.txt file and comply with the restrictions set out in it.

## Vendors

Using the [vendor page]() on [chainmaillers.com]() I created the following list of potential vendors for scraping. In the chart I will include the name of the vendor as a link to their website, whether or not scraping the vendor's product pages is allowed or not, whether or not I plan to scrape the vendor as well as notes on the vendor.

Below is a table of chainmail vendors taken from [chainmaillers.com]()
