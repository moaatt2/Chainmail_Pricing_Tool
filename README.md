# Chainmail Pricing

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to scrape data from various chainmail supply vendors to get pricinging data on the rings they sell. I plan to store and organize the data so that comparisons across vendors can be fairly carried out.

## Responsibility

For each of the vendors whose websites I will scrape in this project I will check their website for a robots.txt file and comply with the restrictions set out in it.

## Vendors

Allowed Vendors(robots.txt permits scraping):
* [The Ring Lord](https://theringlord.com/)
* [Chainmaille Joe](https://www.chainmailjoe.com/)

Disalowed Vendors(robots.txt does not permit scraping):
* [Chain Reaction](https://www.chain-reaction.ca/)
